/**
 * G-code interpreter: modal state machine + motion planner.
 *
 * interpret(text, opts) walks every block, tracks modal state (motion mode,
 * plane, units, distance mode, feed mode, canned-cycle params) and emits a flat
 * list of straight line segments classified as 'rapid' or 'feed'. Arcs are
 * tessellated; drilling canned cycles (G81-G89, G73) and the turning stock
 * removal cycle (G71 + G70) are expanded into their constituent moves.
 *
 * Everything is normalised to millimetres. Inch programs (G20) are scaled on
 * the way in, so downstream rendering and stats are unit-agnostic.
 *
 * Each segment also carries a duration `t` (seconds), derived from the modal
 * feed rate at the time it was emitted. Summed with G4 dwells this gives the
 * program's estimated cycle time.
 *
 * Two machine modes:
 *   'mill' — XY plane (G17) default, X/Y/Z are cartesian, G94 mm/min feed.
 *   'turn' — ZX plane (G18) default, the X word is a *diameter* (halved into a
 *            radius) unless diameterMode is off, and the feed defaults to per
 *            revolution (F × spindle rpm) as on a lathe, until G98/G94.
 *
 * Output segments are intentionally simple ({type, a, b, line, t}) so the
 * worker can pack them into transferable Float32Arrays without reshaping.
