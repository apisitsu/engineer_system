/**
 * libraryStore — the saved-work library: what is in it, and the four things you
 * can do to it (save, open, delete, clear).
 *
 * Thin, as the store layer is meant to be. The record shape, the naming rules
 * and the ordering are `engine/savedWork.js`; the storage is `lib/workApi.js`
 * (the shared server-side library — `lib/workDb.js` is the per-browser IndexedDB
 * store it replaced, kept only for the one-off migration described in
 * `.claude/rules/cam-library-migration.md`);
 * gathering the current session into a project document, and applying one back
 * to the app, is `lib/projectIO.js`. This sequences those three and holds what
 * came back — a list, a busy flag, and the last error.
 *
 * `error` is a string, not a thrown exception, because every one of these
 * actions is a button press: the operator needs a sentence next to the button,
 * not an unhandled rejection in a console they will never open.
